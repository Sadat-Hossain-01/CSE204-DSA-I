List.java: 
The list ADT interface which is implemented by both the array and linked list based implementations

Arr.java: 
Array based implementation of the list ADT

LL.java: 
Linked list based implementation of the list ADT

Main.java: 
This file contains code for exhibiting the 13 different possible operations on the list ADT. The user does not really have to bother have to switch between the two implementations. Every command is similar except 
for the instantiation process. Both instantiations are written but one is commented. Whichever form is intended to be used needs to be the uncommented version.

TNL.java:
The TNL implementation using the coded list ADT. Just like Main.java, whichever implementation is used does not matter except for the initialization. After inputting the proper data, the user has to give the 
proper task number to get the desired output.
